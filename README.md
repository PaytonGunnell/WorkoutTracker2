 This is a Jetpack Compose Android App I am currently working on. It stores and syncs all user data using the Room Database Library, Firebase Realtime Database, and Firebase Authentication. Other technologies used in the app include: Coroutines, Flow, State, Glide, Dagger Hilt, REST API, Ktor, and Compose Destinations.
 Here are some photos of the screens in the app:
